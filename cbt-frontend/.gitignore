# Environment variables (crucial for security)
# General .env files, typically for local development, that should NEVER be committed.
.env
.env.local
.env.development # Explicitly ignore the .env.development file
.env.*.local     # Catches .env.staging.local, etc.
# *.local (From your input - this is too broad and could ignore necessary files,
# so it's kept specific to environment files like .env.local, .env.development, etc.
# If you have other specific *.local files you want to ignore, add them individually.)

# IDE and OS specific files
.vscode/
!.vscode/extensions.json # Added from your input, ensures extensions.json is NOT ignored
.idea/ # IntelliJ IDEA specific files
.DS_Store # macOS generated files
Thumbs.db # Windows generated files
*.suo     # VS specific project files (added from your input)
*.ntvs* # VS specific project files (added from your input)
*.njsproj # VS specific project files (added from your input)
*.sln     # Visual Studio solution files (added from your input)
*.sw?     # Vim swap files (added from your input)

# Backend specific ignores (if they aren't handled by a separate .gitignore inside cbt-backend/)
# If cbt-backend/ has its own .gitignore, these might be redundant but safe as a fallback.
